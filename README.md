# Course: TEAL Formative Assessment
This Moodle course is for Formative Assessment. Formative assessment refers to both the formal and the informal processes that teachers and students use collaboratively to gather evidence of student learning for the purpose of improving the learning. Formative assessment occurs while the learning is taking place, as opposed to summative assessment that typically occurs at the end of a learning unit or course to determine what the student has learned. Formative assessment is a process, not a one-time event; it is assessment for learning, rather than assessment of learning, as with summative assessment. Come learn more about formative assessment!
